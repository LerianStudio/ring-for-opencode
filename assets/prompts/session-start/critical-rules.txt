## Critical Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **NEVER skip verification** - Always verify changes work before claiming completion
2. **NEVER ignore test failures** - Fix failing tests, don't comment them out
3. **NEVER commit secrets** - Check for API keys, passwords, tokens before committing
4. **NEVER make assumptions** - If unclear, ask for clarification
5. **ALWAYS follow project conventions** - Match existing code style and patterns
6. **ALWAYS preserve working code** - Don't break existing functionality
7. **ALWAYS use todowrite tool** - Track multi-step tasks with the todo list
