## 1. Feature Scope

Feature scope determines how many working directories are needed and which agents to dispatch.

| Scope | Description | Working Directories | Agents |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| `backend-only` | API, services, data layer only | Single | backend-engineer-* |
| `frontend-only` | UI, BFF routes only | Single | frontend-*-engineer-* |
| `fullstack` | Both backend and frontend | May require multiple | Both backend and frontend agents |

### When to Use Each Scope

| Scope | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| `backend-only` | REST API endpoint, database migration, background job |
| `frontend-only` | UI component, page layout, client-side validation |
| `fullstack` | User authentication, CRUD feature with UI, real-time updates |

---

## 2. Repository Structure

Repository structure affects how docs are organized and how tasks are distributed.

| Structure | When | Doc Location | Task Distribution |
|-----------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| `single-repo` | All code in one repo, same directory | Unified in `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/` | All tasks in single `tasks.md` |
| `monorepo` | Multiple packages in one repo (e.g., `packages/*`) | Per-module optional | Tasks tagged with `target:` |
| `multi-repo` | Separate repos for backend/frontend | Coordinator repo | Tasks split into `_{module}.tasks.md` |

### Structure Detection Hints

| Indicator | Likely Structure |
|-----------|------------------|
| Single `package.json` or `go.mod` at root | `single-repo` |
| `packages/`, `apps/`, `libs/` directories | `monorepo` |
| User specifies external path | `multi-repo` |

---

## 3. TopologyConfig Schema

TopologyConfig is persisted in the `research.md` frontmatter and propagated through all gates.

```yaml
topology:
  # Required
  scope: fullstack | backend-only | frontend-only
  structure: single-repo | monorepo | multi-repo

  # Required for monorepo and multi-repo
  modules:
    backend:
      path: string          # Relative path (monorepo) or absolute path (multi-repo)
      language: golang | typescript
    frontend:
      path: string          # Relative path (monorepo) or absolute path (multi-repo)
      framework: nextjs | react | vue | angular

  # Required for fullstack
  doc_organization: unified | per-module
```

### Example Configurations

**Single-repo (backend-only):**
```yaml
topology:
  scope: backend-only
  structure: single-repo
```

**Monorepo (fullstack):**
```yaml
topology:
  scope: fullstack
  structure: monorepo
  modules:
    backend:
      path: packages/api
      language: golang
    frontend:
      path: packages/web
      framework: nextjs
  doc_organization: unified
```

**Multi-repo (fullstack):**
```yaml
topology:
  scope: fullstack
  structure: multi-repo
  modules:
    backend:
      path: /home/user/projects/my-api
      language: typescript
    frontend:
      path: /home/user/projects/my-frontend
      framework: react
  doc_organization: per-module
```

---

## 4. Module Organization

### Unified Organization (Default)

All tasks in single `tasks.md` with `target:` tags:

```
docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md
├── prd.md
├── trd.md
└── tasks.md          # All tasks with target: tags
```

**Task format:**
```markdown
## Task 3: Create User API Endpoint

**Target:** backend
**Working Directory:** packages/api
**Agent:** ring:backend-engineer-golang

...task details...
```

### Per-Module Organization

Separate task files per module:

```
docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md
├── prd.md
├── trd.md
├── tasks.md          # Index with all tasks
├── backend/
│   └── tasks.md      # Backend tasks only
└── frontend/
    └── tasks.md      # Frontend tasks only
```

### When to Use Each

| Organization | When | Benefits |
|--------------|------|----------|
| `unified` | Small features, tight integration | Single source of truth, easier to track |
| `per-module` | Large features, separate teams, multi-repo | Independent execution, easier distribution |

---

## 5. Context Switching

### When Context Switch Occurs

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Task `target:` differs from current module | Prompt user for confirmation |
| First task of execution | Set initial module (no prompt) |
| Returning to previously visited module | No prompt (context cached) |
| Shared task (`target: shared`) | Execute in root directory |

### Context Switch Prompt

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Switching to {module} module at {path}. Continue?"
  header: "Context"
  options:
    - label: "Continue"
      description: "Switch to {module} and execute task"
    - label: "Skip task"
      description: "Skip this task and continue"
    - label: "Stop"
      description: "Stop execution"
```

### Optimizing Context Switches

To minimize context switches, execution skills SHOULD batch tasks by module:

```
Original order: [backend, frontend, backend, frontend]
Optimized order: [backend, backend, frontend, frontend]
```

**Note:** Only reorder if tasks have no dependencies between modules.

---

## 6. Multi-Repo Coordination

### Coordinator Repository

When `structure: multi-repo`, the repository where `/pre-dev-feature` is run becomes the "coordinator":

- All pre-dev docs stay in coordinator
- Task files are generated with clear module markers
- Execution requires manual or scripted distribution

### Task Distribution

**Automatic Placement:** Documents are now automatically written to the correct repository based on `doc_placement: distributed`.

- Shared documents (research.md, prd.md, trd.md) are written to both repos
- Backend documents (api-design.md, data-model.md, tasks.md) go to backend repo
- Frontend documents (ux-criteria.md, wireframes/, tasks.md) go to frontend repo

**See Section 9 (Documentation Placement)** for complete placement rules.

**Manual Sync (if needed):**
If automatic placement fails or repos are on different machines:

```bash
# Sync shared docs from backend to frontend
rsync -av {backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/research.md {frontend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
rsync -av {backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/prd.md {frontend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
rsync -av {backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/trd.md {frontend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
```

### Execution in Multi-Repo

When executing multi-repo tasks:
1. Skill reads task's `working_directory`
2. Prompts for context switch (includes full path)
3. Instructs agent to `cd` to target directory
4. Agent reads `PROJECT_RULES.md` from target if exists

---

## 7. PROJECT_RULES.md Hierarchy

### Precedence Rules

In multi-module projects, PROJECT_RULES.md files are merged with clear precedence:

| Level | Location | Precedence |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Root | `./PROJECT_RULES.md` | Lowest (base rules) |
| Module | `{module_path}/PROJECT_RULES.md` | Highest (overrides root) |

### Merge Behavior

```
Root PROJECT_RULES.md:
  - Use conventional commits
  - All code must have tests

Backend PROJECT_RULES.md:
  - Use Go 1.22+
  - Tests use testify

Result for backend tasks:
  - Use conventional commits (from root)
  - All code must have tests (from root)
  - Use Go 1.22+ (from module)
  - Tests use testify (from module)
```

### Conflict Resolution

When same rule exists in both:
- **Module rule wins** - more specific context
- Agent MUST note in output: "Using module-specific rule for X"

---

## 8. API Pattern

API Pattern determines how the frontend communicates with backend services and affects agent assignment.

### Pattern Options

| Pattern | Description | Use When |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `direct` | Frontend calls backend APIs directly | Single backend, simple CRUD, no aggregation |
| `bff` | Frontend calls BFF layer which aggregates backends | Multiple backends, complex transformations, sensitive keys |
| `other` | Custom pattern (GraphQL, tRPC, gateway) | Existing patterns, specific requirements |

### Pattern Decision Criteria

| Criteria | Direct | BFF |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Number of backend services | 1 | 2+ |
| Data aggregation needed | No | Yes |
| Complex transformations | No | Yes |
| API calls per page | <3 | 3+ |
| Sensitive keys to hide | No | Yes |
| Request optimization | Not needed | Needed |

### Agent Assignment by Pattern

| API Pattern | Frontend Tasks | Agent |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| `direct` | UI components, pages, forms | `ring:frontend-engineer` |
| `direct` | Server Actions, data fetching | `ring:frontend-engineer` (Next.js Server Components) |
| `bff` | API routes, data aggregation | `ring:frontend-bff-engineer-typescript` |
| `bff` | UI components, pages | `ring:frontend-engineer` |

### Pattern in TopologyConfig

```yaml
topology:
  scope: fullstack
  structure: single-repo
  api_pattern: bff  # Determines agent assignment
```

### Defaults

| Scope | Default Pattern | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| `fullstack` | `direct` | Simpler architecture, most features don't need BFF |
| `frontend-only` | N/A | Frontend-only already implies client-side |
| `backend-only` | N/A | No frontend to consider |

---

## 9. Documentation Placement

Documentation placement determines where pre-dev artifacts are written based on project structure.

### Placement Modes

| Mode | Structure | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `unified` | single-repo | All docs in `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/` |
| `per-module` | monorepo | Docs distributed to module directories |
| `distributed` | multi-repo | Docs written to each repository |

### Document Types and Placement

| Document | Type | single-repo | monorepo | multi-repo |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| research.md | Shared | Root | Root | Both repos |
| prd.md | Shared | Root | Root | Both repos |
| trd.md | Shared | Root | Root | Both repos |
| ux-criteria.md | Frontend | Root | Frontend module | Frontend repo |
| wireframes/ | Frontend | Root | Frontend module | Frontend repo |
| api-design.md | Backend | Root | Backend module | Backend repo |
| data-model.md | Backend | Root | Backend module | Backend repo |
| dependency-map.md | Split | Root | Root + modules | Per repo |
| tasks.md | Split | Root | Root + modules | Per repo |

### Single-Repo (unified)

All documentation stays in the repository root:

```
docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md
├── prd.md
├── ux-criteria.md
├── wireframes/
├── trd.md
├── api-design.md
├── data-model.md
├── dependency-map.md
└── tasks.md
```

### Monorepo (per-module)

Shared docs at root, module-specific docs in module directories:

```
# Root (shared)
docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md
├── prd.md
├── trd.md
└── tasks.md           # Index with all tasks

# Backend module
{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── api-design.md
├── data-model.md
├── dependency-map.md  # Backend dependencies
└── tasks.md           # Backend tasks only

# Frontend module
{frontend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── ux-criteria.md
├── wireframes/
├── dependency-map.md  # Frontend dependencies
└── tasks.md           # Frontend tasks only
```

### Multi-Repo (distributed)

Shared docs copied to both repos, module-specific docs in respective repos:

```
# Backend repository
{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md        # Copy of shared
├── prd.md             # Copy of shared
├── trd.md             # Copy of shared
├── api-design.md
├── data-model.md
├── dependency-map.md
└── tasks.md           # Backend tasks only

# Frontend repository
{frontend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── research.md        # Copy of shared
├── prd.md             # Copy of shared
├── trd.md             # Copy of shared
├── ux-criteria.md
├── wireframes/
├── dependency-map.md
└── tasks.md           # Frontend tasks only
```

### Implementation Notes

**For skills writing documents:**

1. Read `topology.structure` from research.md frontmatter
2. Use path resolution logic from `topology-discovery.md`
3. Create directories before writing
4. For multi-repo shared docs, write to both paths

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Single-repo behavior is unchanged
- Existing projects without `doc_placement` default to `unified`
- Skills MUST handle missing `topology` in frontmatter gracefully
